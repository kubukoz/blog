        <title>Learning vim by blogging</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided that writing about something is one of the easiest ways to learn it for a longer period of time. In this blog post, which I hope to update once in a while, I’ll be sharing my findings about Vim (neovim).&lt;/p&gt;
