week ago, while coming back from Scalar, I was thinking about coherent data. In particular, I was wondering if it's possible to perform certain simple validations and encode their results in types. Here's what i found.\nWhat is coherent data\nThe concept of coherent data was introduced to me when I watched Daniel Spiewak's talk about coherence. Data coherence is achieved when we have a single source of truth about our data. Let's look at an example:\nval name: Option[String] = Some(\"Rachel\")\n\nval result: String =\n  if(name.isEmpty) \"default\"\n  else name.get\n\nIn this code we don't have any sort of coherence in the data. One condition that we check - the emptiness of name - gives us information that is immediately lost in the rest of the code. Even if we've checked for the emptiness and are sure that the Option isn't empty, there's nothing in the type system or any other feature of the language that would tell us whether we can call Option#get on it safely. We only know that because we keep in mind that we've already checked for the emptiness ourselves.\nAnother example involves lists:\nval names: List[String] = List(\"Phoebe\", \"Joey\", \"Ross\")\n\nval firstNameLength: Option[Int] =\n  if(names.isEmpty) None\n  else Some(names.head.length)\n\nEven though we've checked for the list's emptiness, we still have no guarantee that head, which is in general not a safe method to call on a list, won't throw an exception.\nThere's no connection between isEmpty and head/get enforced by the compiler. It's just incapable of helping us avoid mistakes like this:\nif(elems.isEmpty) println(elems.head) //boom!\n\nIs this the way it's meant to be? Is it possible to make the compiler work with us to ensure some guarantees about our data?\nIn Kotlin, another language that works on the JVM (mostly), there is a feature that solves this particular problem we had with Option: smart casts. But the feature is limited to checking types or nullity, while we're looking for something that'll work in the general case.\nThankfully, there're features in Scala that allow us to reason about our data as coherent: pattern matching and higher-order functions.\nData coherence with pattern matching\nLet's rewrite the examples from the previous section using pattern matching:\nval name: Option[String] = Some(\"Rachel\")\n\nval result = name match {\n  case None    =&gt; \"default\"\n  case Some(v) =&gt; v\n}\n\nMuch better - now we managed to get both the emptiness check and the extraction in one go (in the pattern match). We're not calling any unsafe methods, and we get additional help from the compiler in the form of exhaustivity checking. What about lists?\nval names: List[String] = List(\"Phoebe\", \"Joey\", \"Ross\")\n\nval firstNameLength: Option[Int] = names match {\n  case Nil            =&gt; None\n  case firstName :: _ =&gt; Some(firstName.length)\n}\n\nAgain, we're not calling head or any other unsafe method. And the check is again combined with the extraction in a single pattern match.\nI mentioned higher-order functions, so what about them? Turns out that pattern matches (and functions implemented using them) can often be rewritten using a single call to fold for the given data type. It's more obvious in the case of Option:\nval name: Option[String] = Some(\"Rachel\")\n\nval result = name.fold(\"default\")(identity)\n\nOr Either:\nval name: Either[NameNotFound, String] = Right(\"Rachel\")\n\nval result = name.fold(extractError, identity)\n\nHowever, fold doesn't appear to be the right choice if we only care about part of the data (like in the list example, where we only needed the head of the list). In that particular case, a good old headOption would work just fine.\nData coherence at scale\nThis is all nice and pretty - the promise of having data that doesn't require us to watch our backs every step we take sounds encouraging. But when the data is part of other data, things start to break very soon.\nSuppose we're working with a User class:\ncase class User(name: String, lastName: Option[String])\n\nNow imagine we want to run a code path only if the user has a lastName set. The caveat: we still want to pass the User instance:\ndef withValidatedUser(lastName: String, user: User): IO[Int] = ...\n\nval user = User(\"Katie\", Some(\"Bouman\"))\n\nuser.lastName match {\n  case Some(last) =&gt; withValidatedUser(last, user)\n  case None       =&gt; IO.pure(42)\n}\n\nWhat's the problem? Well, even though we did the validation in a coherent way using a pattern match, we lose the coherence inside withValidatedUser: lastName is now completely separated from the User object it came from. And now we have two lastNames: one optional, one required.\ndef withValidatedUser(lastName: String, user: User): IO[Int] = IO {\n  println((lastName, user.lastName))\n}\n\nThis is terrible news. It appears like we can't maintain data coherence when the data is part of something else. Or can we?\nSurely there are ways to get what we want - one of them is adding a new variant of the User class, but with a required lastName:\ncase class UserWithLast(name: String, lastName: String)\n\n...but you can probably already imagine how much boilerplate it'd bring to your codebase if you needed a new class for every combination of optional fields if the User type had more than one:\ncase class User(\n  name: String,\n  lastName: Option[String],\n  email: Option[String])\n\ncase class UserWithLastAndEmail(\n  name: String,\n  lastName: String,\n  email: String)\n\ncase class UserNoEmail(name: String, lastName: String)\n\ncase class UserNoLast(name: String, email: String)\n...\n\nIt doesn't seem like a viable solution to the problem. In fact, it'd create more problems than it solved.\nI entertained the idea that we could parameterize our original User with type parameters a bit:\ncase class User[LastName](name: String, lastName: LastName)\n\n//just so that we have some distinction below\ntype LastName = String\n\ndef withValidatedUser(user: User[LastName]): IO[Int] = ...\n\nval user: User[Option[LastName]] = User(\"Katie\", Some(\"Bouman\"))\n\n// try it at home: this could be a fold!\nuser.lastName match {\n  case Some(last) =&gt; withValidatedUser(user.copy(lastName = last))\n  case None       =&gt; IO.pure(42)\n}\n\nNow a few things happened:\n\nWe're not passing the lastName value separately now\nlastName being required is now a type-level prerequisite in withValidatedUser\nWe're copying the user value with lastName substituted with the value extracted from Option using a pattern match\nWe only have one data type that supports all combinations of emptiness/non-emptiness using type parameters.\n\nWhat does this give us?\nWe gained type safety in withValidatedUser - the function now can't be called with a User whose lastName hasn't been checked for non-emptiness. It just won't compile if we pass an Option in that field. One less test case to worry about.\nIt's also pretty interesting that we can now write functions that require the user to not have a second name:\ndef withInvalidUser(user: User[Unit]): String = user.name\n\nFor me, the most surprising part here was that I couldn't use Nothing as the type of lastName - which I wanted to do to guarantee that lastName just isn't there. However, we can't create values of type Nothing, and we can't pass them as constructor parameters of a class. I used Unit instead, which is a type with only one value, which is obviously not the user's last name. Creating a user with LastName = Unit is also very easy: User(\"Joe\",  ()).\nWhat's the problem with the latest solution?\n\nWe made it more difficult to work with the User type - now everyone who uses that type needs to be aware that the lastName field is parameterized. And it's viral - pretty soon all the codebase will be littered with type parameters irrelevant in these regions of code.\nWe can insert any type we want as LastName. It could even be IO[Unit]. And it's very easy to do so.\n\nLooks like we aren't quite there yet. What can we do to make our type easier to work with?\nA different kind of coherence\nOur original goal in the exercise was to encode validations and invariants of our data in the data's type. Let's get back to our User example. This time we'll encode it using higher-kinded types (but with two \"variable-effect\" fields):\n(if you're not familiar with higher-kinded types, I suggest you check out some blog posts. For now, it should be enough to know that a higher-kinded type is a type-level function, or a type that needs to be applied with another type to construct a fully concrete type that can be assigned to a value. For example Option needs an A to become Option[A], a type that has values.\nIf we parameterize User with higher-kinded types, we get this:\ncase class User[LastName[_], Email[_]](\n  name: String,\n  lastName: LastName[String],\n  email: Email[String]\n)\n\nCool. How do we create a User with all fields optional now?\nval jon: User[Option, Option] =\n  User[Option, Option](\"Jon\", Some(\"Snow\"), None)\n\nHow do we create one with some fields required?\n// old trick from scalaz/cats/shapeless\ntype Id[A] = A\n\nval jon: User[Id, Option] = User[Id, Option](\"Jon\", \"Snow\", None)\n\nAlso cool. We can't assign None as the value of lastName if LastName is Id. How would we encode the requirement that there's no email now?\ntype Void[A] = Unit\n\nval donald: User[Id, Void] = User[Id, Void](\"Donald\", \"Duck\", ())\n\nAs you can see, we cheated a bit - the goal of parameterizing our type with higher-kinded types was to ensure that we always have String (or whatever used to be in an Option) in an effect (like Option or Id), but if the effect is A =&gt; Unit, we have no String in the result whatsoever. Is it bad?\nMaybe, maybe not.\nIf we have type parameters for our data, we can't make it obligatory to have String anywhere in the type of Email. (well, maybe we could, using some more type-level machinery and implicits, but I don't want to go that deep into it).\nHowever, we're making it harder to use a type that doesn't have the String in it (Option is a more obvious choice for a type parameter than, say, λ[A =&gt; Int], which would mean that lastName is of type Int). And we still get an escape hatch that allows us to omit some fields in a User value (by saying that lastName is of type Unit).\nInstead of a custom Void type, we could've used Const:\nimport cats.data.Const\n\nval john = User[Id, Const[(), ?]](\"John\", \"De Goes\", Const(()))\njohn.email.getConst // equals ()\n\nWe had at least two problems with the previous solution:\n\nthe type parameters would spread out to every place in the codebase where User appears.\nwe didn't have type-level hints as to what type we should use.\n\nI believe the second problem is not an issue anymore (see above argument about Unit), but the first one remains: everywhere we had\ndef foo: User =&gt; A, we'll now have\ndef foo[F[_], G[_]]: User[F, G] =&gt; A. What can we do to make this a little more pleasant, and to avoid spreading every single type parameter to pieces of code that don't care about the contents of our parameterized fields?\nVariance and higher kinded types\nThankfully, Scala has quite powerful support for variance annotations. We can use it to our advantage: to make our type easier to work with.\nSuppose we are writing a function that takes a user but only uses their first name - which isn't type parameterized. Let's recall the definition of User:\ncase class User[LastName[_], Email[_]](\n  name: String,\n  lastName: LastName[String],\n  email: Email[String]\n)\n\nLet's add some variance annotations...\ncase class User[+LastName[_], +Email[_]](\n  name: String,\n  lastName: LastName[String],\n  email: Email[String]\n)\n\nobject User {\n  // apparently, Any is kind-polymorphic\n  // and counts as a suitable * -&gt; * kinded type!\n  type Arb = User[Any, Any]\n}\n\nMaking our type covariant in both type parameters should allow us to pass a User[F, G] for any F and G where a User[Any, Any] (User.Arb) is required. Let's see if it works:\ndef nameTwice(user: User.Arb): String = user.name ++ user.name\n\n&gt; nameTwice(User[Option, Id](\"Mike\", None, \"mike@evilmail.com\"))\nres0: String = \"MikeMike\"\n\nLooks like it does. However, maybe hardcoding Any, Any isn't the best solution there - what if at some point we actually want to perform some validation and use the parameterized fields? Maybe a better encoding would be this:\n//class User defined as above\n\nobject User {\n  type Canonical = User[Option, Option]\n}\n\nNow we could write functions taking User.Canonical as the base case, and only customize the functions that we want to work with certain types of User specifically.\ndef worksWithAllUsers(user: User.Canonical): (String, String) =\n  (user.lastName, user.email) match {\n    case (Some(lastName), Some(email)) =&gt;\n      withFullUser(\n        user.copy[Id, Id](\n          lastName = lastName,\n          email = email\n        )\n      )\n\n    case (Some(lastName), None) =&gt;\n      withPartialUser(user.copy[Id, Option](lastName = lastName))\n\n    case _ =&gt;\n      (\"Default\", \"default@evilmail.com\")\n}\n\ndef withFullUser(user: User[Id, Id]): (String, String) =\n  (user.lastName, user.email)\n\ndef withPartialUser(user: User[Id, Any]): (String, String) =\n  (user.lastName, \"default@evilmail.com\")\n\nOther possible use cases\nWhat other invariants can we encode?\n\nOption[A] can become A or Unit.\nEither[A, B] can become B or A.\nList[A] can become Unit (empty list) or (A, List[A]) (NonEmptyList[A]).\n\n(note how we're deconstructing the data types, which happen to be ADTs, into coproducts)\nIf we're really trying to experiment, we can go the extra mile:\n\nList[A] can be checked for length and encoded as Sized[List[A], 5].\nUser[IO[A]] can become IO[User[A]] (sounds like Traverse, doesn't it?) - we can run the IO outside and keep the result to avoid unnecessary recalculation.\nUser[Stream[IO, A]] can become IO[User[List[A]]] - we can run the stream and work with it as a list, once it's all consumed (that is, if it fits into the memory).\n\nThere's a lot we can do, really:\n\nString -&gt; NonEmptyString, regex\"(a-Z)+\", IPv4, INetAddress refined types\nInt -&gt; PosInt / EvenInt refined types, smaller primitives (Byte, etc.)\n\nSummary\nThere are a few good reasons for trying to make our data coherent, including but not limited to using the techniques mentioned in this post:\n\nadditional type safety by enforcing constraints locally on the type level\nincreased ease of putting code under test - if your function doesn't depend on lastName, you can pass () in that field safely\n\nHowever, there are difficulties associated with all that:\n\ntype parameters creeping into all your functions (possibly can be avoided by introducing a canonical type and only being specific when it's needed)\nit's questionable whether parameterizing data with types scales (e.g. if we have case class Users[Collection[_], LastName[_]](users: Collection[User[LastName]]), is it going to be easy to change?)\nthe benefit might not be that significant after all\nit was mentioned in the replies that type-parameterizing e.g. JSON models can break tooling like circe, magnolia, etc. - most likely because they don't support GADTs\npossibly more problems that I haven't figured out yet.\n\nI haven't seen this approach to abstracting on data used anywhere, so I don't know what the best practice is, and whether the idea is feasible for use in real projects, but it certainly seems worth investigating.\nMaybe type-parameterized data would work better with lenses (e.g. from Monocle) to make the work with copying more pleasant and less boilerplatey?\nAs some of our validations involved e.g. breaking up Option into a tagged coproduct of Unit and A (which it is), maybe the techniques mentioned in this post could be used together with optics like Prisms (which are meant for working with coproducts) to form more powerful abstractions?\nMaybe we could have a Monad/Traverse/whatever instance for a type like case class User[LastName[_], Email[_]](...) for each of its fields to get additional functionality for free using the functions defined on the appropriate typeclass?\nAs you can see, more insight into the possibilities is needed to determine if the concept can be used more widely in our code.\nParting words\nThank you for reading.\nThese ideas are very fresh for me, and I haven't spent a lot of time researching them yet. In the future, I hope to spend more time in this area and to develop a more formal or constrained description of the ideas mentioned here.\nMost importantly, I hope to find out whether these ideas actually help achieve more type safety without sacrificing maintainability in real world programming.\nLet me know what you think about the ideas presented in this post, and whether you enjoyed reading it!\nThanks to Igal Tabachnik (@hmemcpy) and Valérian (@etaty) who found and reported a few bugs in this post.

In fact, often it seems to be one of the hardest things\nin computer science and programming in general. In addition, sometimes a single word has multiple meanings,\nor worse - a term is explained in a variety of slightly differing definitions. One such term is a pure function.\n\nI'm by no means an expert in functional programming, but the definition of a pure function that I consider to be true\nis the same one as plenty of people use.\nThat definition doesn't distinguish pure and impure functions, though - all functions are\npure, but the impure things we sometimes call functions, aren't. They are impure, and I call them procedures.\nWhat makes a function a function, then?\nThe point of this post is to answer that question in a way that'll be relatively easy\nto understand for people with basic to intermediate experience with programming and Scala.\nThe definition for a function (and for functional programming) I use is very similar\nto the one John A de Goes tweeted some time ago. Functions are:\n\nTotal - they are defined for every input\nDeterministic - a function will always return the same value given the same input.\nPure - their only effect is computing their output\n\nIf we define functions like the above, then functional programming is\nprogramming with functions,without procedures.\nLet's look at these properties and see how they differ from those of what I defined as procedures.\nTotality\nFor a function to be total, we must make sure that it returns a value\nfor every kind of input that the compiler allows it to take.\nThat means it can't throw exceptions to the caller, like in the following example:\ndef validate(user: User): String = {\n  val trimmed = user.name.trim\n  if(trimmed.isEmpty) throw new Exception(\"Name is empty!\")\n  else trimmed\n}\n\nThe above code compiles, and validate(\"\") will compile too (as a method call\nwith a result type of String), but it'll crash at runtime, unless the exception is caught.\nThat makes validate a partial function, because it doesn't have a\ndefined value of its declared type (String) for an empty string - in fact,\nit doesn't have one for any kind of input consisting exclusively of whitespace.\nOne functional alternative to this would be to use Option:\ndef validate(user: User): Option[String] = user.name.trim match {\n  case \"\" =&gt; None\n  case trimmed =&gt; Some(trimmed)\n}\n\nOr, if you want more information about the origin of failure, Either (if you\nlike typed errors, that'd probably involve creating an ADT for possible errors):\nsealed trait UserError extends Product with Serializable\ncase object NameIsEmpty extends UserError\n\ndef validate(user: User): Either[UserError, String] =\n  user.name.trim match {\n    case \"\" =&gt; Left(NameIsEmpty)\n    case trimmed =&gt; Right(trimmed)\n  }\n\nAnother solution would involve tagless style with ApplicativeError:\ntype UserErrors[F[_]] = ApplicativeError[F, UserError]\n\ndef validate[F[_]: UserErrors](user: User): F[String] = {\n  user.name.trim\n    .some.filter(_.nonEmpty)\n    .liftTo[F](NameIsEmpty: UserError)\n}\n\ntype E[A] = Either[String, A]\nvalidate[E](User(\"foo\"))\n\nBy moving from throwing exceptions, we gain in at least a few ways:\n\nit becomes more explicit for the callers what kind of errors they can observe in case of failure\nthe types will tell us whether a function actually can fail or not\nwe avoid the overhead of creating an exception\n\nand our function becomes total, because invalid inputs will give us a value (e.g. a Left)\nDeterminism\nIn order for a function to be deterministic, it has to return the same value\nevery time it's called with the same arguments. Because of that, something like the following is not pure:\ndef foo(): Int = {\n  Random.nextInt()\n}\n\nThe type of foo is () =&gt; Int, or Unit =&gt; Int, so we can basically say that\nit has one possible input (the value () of type Unit, in this case represented\nby \"no arguments passed\"). This would mean that every call to this function will\nreturn the same value, but it's quite the opposite - it'll usually return completely different values.\nA simple way to ensure determinism of the above would be to allow passing\na seed to the randomizer, instead of using a global Random instance:\ndef foo(seed: Int): Int = {\n  new Random(seed).nextInt()\n}\n\nNow, calling foo with the same input will yield the same outputs.\nAnother example of a nondeterministic function can be a simple call to a database:\n//let's pretend I'm using Slick\ndef findAllUsers(): List[User] = {\n  val f = db.run {\n    TableQuery[Users].to[List].result\n  }\n\n  //please don't do this in real code\n  Await.result(f, 5.seconds)\n}\n\nThe Await call was added only to make sure that we have a result immediately when the function completes.\nIf we change the state of the database between a few calls to this function,\nit'll yield different results. A functional, yet implausible solution would be to\npass the state of the database as input to the function, or use some sort of State monad.\nAn alternative, arguably better solution would be to suspend\nthe side effect (reading from external mutable state) in an effect,\nwhich is what we'll discuss in the part of this post about First-class effects.\nPurity\nI already said that a function is pure because its only effect is computing its output.\nDoes it mean that by programming with functions we aren't allowed to write to a database or to standard output?\nNot at all! Writing functions that execute I/O operations, or any other kind of effects,\nis possible, and it's way easier than naming things, in fact. However, it doesn't mean\nwe're allowed to have functions with side effects.\nWhat does it mean to have side effects, and how do we get effects (like talking to\nexternal systems) without side effects? We need referential transparency.\nAnd side effects are its exact opposite.\nReferential transparency\nA definition of referential transparency found in\nThe red book (Functional Programming in Scala by Runar Bjarnason and Paul Chiusano)\nsays:\n\nAn expression e is referentially transparent if, for all programs p,\nall occurrences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e\nwithout affecting the meaning of p.\nA function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent\nfor all referentially transparent x.\n\nLet me follow up with an example:\nval a = 2 + 1\nval e = a + 1\nval p = e + e\n\nOur e is a + 1. Our program p has two appearances of e.\nIn its current shape, the value of p can be computed by calculating a, e and p in that order:\na = 2 + 1 = 3\ne = a + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\np = e + e = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nIf we can apply the replacement of e in the original program with\nthe result of evaluating e (a + 1), then e is referentially transparent. Let's do that:\nval a = 2 + 1\nval p = (a + 1) + (a + 1)\n\nWhat's the value of p now?\np = ((2 + 1) + 1) + (2 + 1) + 1) = (3 + 1) + (3 + 1) = 4 + 4 = 8\nAs you see, the value of p hasn't changed. The behavior of\nthe program p didn't change either, as its only effect was computing the value (which is 8). That means e was referentially transparent - we replaced the reference to a value (e) with the value (a + 1).\nThis is very much like math from school - you didn't see\nanything impure in your textbooks, all your expressions were pure,\nand you could apply substitution in a similar way:\nf(x) = x + 1\n\ng(x) = f(x + 1) + f(x)\ng(x) = ((x + 1) + 1) + (x + 1) = 2x + 3\n\nSo far, no side effects. Let's introduce some:\nval x = {\n  println(\"Foo\")\n  1\n}\n\nval p = x + x\n\nIf we ran the above lines in a REPL session, or as part of a larger program, the effects would be:\n\nthe value of p becomes 2 (every time)\nthe line Foo is printed to console output once.\n\nWhat would happen if we inlined x into the places where it's used?\nval p = {\n  println(\"Foo\")\n  1\n} + {\n  println(\"Foo\")\n  1\n}\n\nNow, if we ran the above lines, the result would be vastly different from the previous one, perhaps unsurprisingly:\n\nthe value of p still becomes 2 (every time)\nthe line Foo is printed to console output twice.\n\nUnless all the effects of your programs are idempotent\n(running them multiple times yields the same result as running them once),\nwhich I doubt, then this should feel troubling: after all,\nthe only thing we did was inline a read-only variable (val x).\nAnd now the program behaves in a different way.\nThat's precisely because the implementation of x was impure - it had\na secondary effect (or a side effect) of console output. This could just as well be\na database-mutating call, or a HTTP POST request being sent to a remote server.\nIn many cases, it would become a bug.\nThere are other ways to break referential transparency.\nIf the value of x depended on external conditions (like if it was getting its value from console input),\nthe correctness of the program after inlining could break in many more ways:\nval x = StdIn.readLine()\n\nval prog1 = (x, x)\nval prog2 = (StdIn.readLine(), StdIn.readLine())\n\nval b = prog1 == prog2\n\nIn the above code, the tuple contained by prog1 will always have\nthe same value in both fields. In fact, if we only ran the code up to the definition of prog1:\nval x = StdIn.readLine()\n\nval prog1 = (x, x)\n\nWe would be asked to enter console input once, and the value we typed\nwould be stored in x for as long as x's lifetime lasts. Because of that, it'd appear twice in prog1.\nHowever, if we only ran the line where prog2 is defined:\nval prog2 = (StdIn.readLine(), StdIn.readLine())\n\nWe would be asked for input twice, and assuming there are n possible strings\nwe could input, the chance that both values in prog2 would be the same\nwould be equal to only 1/n (as opposed to 100% in prog1). And the only difference\nbetween prog1 and prog2 was the inlining of x = StdIn.readLine().\nThere are many other ways to break referential transparency in Scala, for example throwing exceptions:\nval prog1 = Try(throw new Exception)\n\nval x = throw new Exception\nval prog2 = Try(x)\n\nor executing any kind of impure logic inside scala.concurrent.Future:\nval x = Future { println(\"Foo\") }\n\nval prog1 = (x zip x)\nval prog2 = (Future { println(\"Foo\") } zip Future { println(\"Foo\") })\n\nFuture behaves just like a raw, uncut side effect: its value is cached, so regardless of how many times you use\nan already created Future, it'll only run once and it'll always contain the same value upon completion or failure.\nThat's because Future isn't a description of an asynchronous computation: it's already running one.\nIf we can't rely on Future to give us the safety of refactoring (inlining values or extracting expressions to values),\ndoes it mean we're doomed to have side effects in meaningful Scala programs?\nThankfully, it doesn't.\nFirst-class effects\nA term often used to describe effects without side effects is \"first class effects\". They are effects that don't break\nreferential transparency. A workaround often used to simulate support for first class effects in Scala\ninvolves by-name parameters:\n//artificial type\nfinal class Effectful[T] private(run: () =&gt; T) {\n  def zip[U](b: Effectful[U]): Effectful[(T, U)] =\n    new Effectful(() =&gt; (run(), b.run()))\n}\n\n//function with by-name parameter\ndef effect[T](f: =&gt; T): Effectful[T] = new Effectful(() =&gt; f)\n\nval x = effect(println(\"Foo\"))\n\nval prog1 = x zip x\n\nval prog2 = effect(println(\"Foo\")) zip effect(println(\"Foo\"))\n\nIn this example, we created a new, \"artificial\" type Effectful[T] (it's probably not a good idea to try\nand come up with a type like this on your own). It describes a computation that will complete with a value of type T.\nWe gave it a method zip that will produce a new Effectful that will run two Effectful programs sequentially.\nIf we were to call prog1.run() or prog2.run(), you'd see that they behave identically - they'll both print Foo twice.\nThankfully, we don't need to come up with a type like this (and I don't recommend that you do - unless\nyou're absolutely sure the existing ones don't meet your needs).\nThere's plenty of competing options one can use in a similar way to how we used Effectful and def effect.\nHere are a few that are the most popular in late 2018:\n\ncats-effect IO[+A]\nscalaz-zio IO[+E, +A]\nMonix Task[+A].\n\nFrom the referential transparency/purity point of view, they behave in the same way - if we \"suspend\" side-effecting\noperations using an operator that allows \"delaying\" a computation (for example, by taking a by-name parameter),\nthey'll give us the properties we need. One significant difference in the above is in terms of\nerror handling - zio allows an IO to fail with an error value of type E that you can specify on your own,\nbut the other two (cats-effect IO and Monix Task) only allow failure with values that extend Throwable.\nWhether one solution has significant advantages over the other is a question for a different post ;)\nAll things considered, all of the above types support suspending synchronous effects (like printing to standard output,\nor executing a JDBC call) and asynchronous, non-blocking effects (like communicating through HTTP or\nlistening for messages from Kafka). The main difference between these types and Future is that they are able to\ndescribe a computation that can be ran at some point after they're defined, while Future is\na handle to an already running computation.\nFor the next part of the post, I'll use cats-effect's IO.\nLet's recreate the printing example that we were able to make referentially transparent with Effectful:\nimport cats.syntax.apply._\nimport cats.effect.IO\n\n/*\n * expands to `IO.apply(println(...))`,\n * defined as `def apply[T](f: =&gt; T): IO[T]`\n * `IO.apply` is equivalent to `IO.delay`\n */\nval x = IO(println(\"Foo\"))\n\nval prog1 = (x, x).tupled\n\nval prog2 = (IO(println(\"Foo\")), IO(println(\"Foo\"))).tupled\n\nAgain, running prog1 and/or prog2 will involve printing twice in each of them. That's why\nwe say IO is referentially transparent, or pure.\nA word on determinism and IO\nEarlier, I claimed that a function needs to return the same output for the same input. Would this be a function, then?\ndef foo: IO[Int] = IO {\n  Random.nextInt()\n}\n\nSome people would argue that it's not - because it's not deterministic. They argue that calling foo multiple times\nwill give you different results. But that's not true - just calling foo always gives you\nthe same action - nothing happens until you evaluate the IO. In fact, the whole function could be a constant:\nval foo: IO[Int] = IO { Random.nextInt() }\n\nAnd as a constant it must be deterministic. The fact that evaluating it multiple times will give us different\nresults doesn't matter. One of the points of functions being deterministic is to allow storing them as values,\nand reusing them. Take a look:\ndef foo(i: Int): IO[Unit]\nval program = foo(5) *&gt; bar &lt;* foo(5)\n\nval program2 = baz &lt;* foo(5)\n\nBecause all the calls to foo are the same, we can store the result of such a call and reuse it, while maintaining\nthe original behavior:\ndef foo(i: Int): IO[Unit]\n\nval foo5: IO[Unit] = foo(5)\n\nval program = foo5 *&gt; bar &lt;* foo5\n\nval program2 = baz &lt;* foo5\n\n\"How do we evaluate an IO?\", you may ask. I'll respond, \"with IOApp\" (for example):\nimport cats.effect._\nimport cats.implicits._\n\nobject Main extends IOApp {\n  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = {\n    val foo = IO(println(\"Foo\"))\n\n    foo *&gt; foo *&gt; foo\n  }.as(ExitCode.Success)\n}\n\nThanks for reading\nI hope that you liked this not-so-short explanation of pure functions and that you'll benefit from it as much as me\nand other people who believe in functional programming.
