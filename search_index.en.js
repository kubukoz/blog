the very first day I started learning how to program, I had questions. So many questions!\nThing is, after some time, as my career progressed, I ended up being on the receiving end of such questions more and more. That never changed - in fact, I'm used to people asking for help many times a day.\nAll of this is to say, I've asked and been asked probably thousands of questions - good ones, but also bad ones, and I would like to share a couple of tips on how to ask better questions.\nThese tips will not only help you reach a solution sooner, but possibly a better solution altogether.\nWhat's a question?\nBefore we get to the tips, I want to highlight what kind of questions this could be useful for.\nIn the context of this post, \"asking a question\" means any action that you perform to get help from other people in solving a problem.\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\n\nreporting an issue in a project (\"the command X doesn't work\", \"can you add a Y function?\")\nrequesting assistance in your work (\"my code crashes\", \"I can't publish to Maven Central\")\nlearning (\"what does this function do?\", \"what's the best way to publish a Scala library?\")\n\nTo sum up, the practices described here can be used in a variety of contexts.\nDue dilligence\nBefore submitting the question or issue, ensure you've done as much as you reasonably could by yourself. Reasonably - because nobody would want you to spend a week searching for an answer they could give you in five minutes.\nMany Open Source projects will have a checklist for this, and you can make your own if you like. Here are a couple of things to try:\nIs this an XY problem?\nThe first thing you should check for is the possibility of asking a completely misguided question.\nIt's a common trap that you see a problem, come up with a solution, encounter a roadblock while trying to implement it... then get hung up on that solution.\nWhereas it may be a genuinely legitimate way to get to your goal, it's a good idea to take a step back and ponder:\n\nIs this really the right way to approach this?\n\nYou may find that it's not - that you're jumping through hoops to make that solution match the problem, or trying to fit this problem into that solution.\nIf you're lucky, someone aware of this phenomenon will ask you: Is this an XY problem?\nFrom xyproblem.info:\n\nThe XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem.\nThis leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.\n\nOnce I learned about this, I started seeing myself and my peers fall into this trap unreasonably often, and I agree with the statement above - it can be a massive waste of time.\nBeing aware of this pitfall is incredibly useful: we can fight against it.\nConsider if you're asking the right question. Give your audience a sneak peek of \"the bigger picture\" of what you're trying to get done.\nThis will allow them to suggest a better way to do that, if there is one.\nSearch around\nIn general, exploration in search of a solution can be very productive, and serve as a great learning experience too.\nThere are many places to look in, though, so here are a couple of ideas to get you started.\nSearch engines\nUse a search engine - it can be Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or whatever you use. Run some basic searches and sift through a couple of pages of the results.\nKnowledge bases\nFor OSS projects, this could be GitHub Issues or Discussions - maybe the question you meant to post has already been asked.\nMaybe the bug you encountered has already been reported and then closed as \"not a bug\".\nWho knows, maybe it's been fixed and will be available in the next release!\nAt work, you can often find useful nuggets of information on Slack and your team's Wiki.\nDocumentation\nIf you can find it, reach for the documentation. If you can't - you can start by asking for instructions on where to get it.\nDocumentation could also be code or a product brief. You may be able to gather some information about why what you're trying to do doesn't work, and maybe even figure out a way to fix it - always useful information to bring in a bug report.\nUpdate your software\nEnsure that the problem is visible on the latest available version of the software you're having problems with.\nSometimes we use older versions of software without being aware of a more recent release,\nor there's been a change in the project that hasn't yet been released - we can only try it out after switching to a snapshot/nightly distribution channel.\nDoing that extra step to get these unreleased changes is usually not strictly necessary, but it may obviate the need for posting an issue, or at least for the maintainers to run that step for you.\nEven if you're stuck on an older version, it's good to know whether the problem has already been solved.\nMaybe it's you\nSometimes we are just wrong and don't realize we're the ones making a mistake, especially after a long session of debugging.\nStay humble, take a break, look at the problem with fresh eyes and see if you find any flaws in your approach.\nNevertheless, don't get blocked - if you honestly see no way forward, asking for help is the right call.\nIf you're not sure about something, just mention that in the question - you don't have to know everything.\nYou can even start by asking an easier, more general question, just to validate your understanding - these questions tend to get answered quicker.\nContext\nIf you've done your research and still feel like you need help, now's the time to start writing: gather all the useful information about your problem, and try to materialize that in your question.\nHow much is too much?\nSome questions certainly require more insight into the problem, while some can be answered just based on a single sentence. I generally practice the following approach:\nMinimal, yet sufficient.\nThat's deliberately vague - I'm afraid you'll have to figure out how much detail to provide on a case-by-case basis, but usually you'll need to post more information for more complex issues.\nWhat I can give you, though, is a blueprint.\nStoryline\nYour question should tell a story. You're the main character, and the issue you're facing is the villain.\nFocusing on your story's most important plot points will make it easier to follow, and help make sure you don't miss any crucial details.\nPrologue\nProvide some background to explain where the main character is coming from, and what their motivation is.\nState the problem you're trying to solve, what you're trying to achieve - focus on the end goal, not the implementation details (also see the XY problem).\nSetup\nThen, there's the setup of the story: how did you run into this problem?\nFocus on the steps that took you there, without judgement: just state the facts of what you did that triggered the issue. How does the hero bump into the bad guy?\nPlot twist\nYou were expecting everything would go according to the plan, but something else happened. What does your ideal scenario look like, and what's the reality?\nThe investigation\nYou've already tried to overcome the problem - share your past attempts, and explain why you think they weren't successful. It can be helpful to rule out distractions and dead ends.\nIs there a pattern in what the issue looks like? Does it happen every time you retrace your steps, or was there something peculiar about that one attempt? (see also: reproducible example)\nDo you have any other information that could be relevant?\nThe cliffhanger\nAfter all, we're hoping to get a sequel - a response that explains it all, and a culmination of our characters' arcs.\nBefore you submit your story for print, you can tease the reader a bit, by telling them what will happen if the villain isn't stopped:\nIs this issue critical for you? Does it block you? Do you have a workaround that you can apply in the meantime?\nAny alternatives that you can use - while the issue is being figured out - will be helpful to others who find themselves in an identical situation.\nKeep in mind, though - if you're going to mention that the issue is critical to you and your team, that doesn't give you any more right to a reply than anyone else. Don't act entitled!\nExample\nAn important part of every code-related question is an example. If you're asking a question in the style of \"this doesn't work\" or \"I want to do X\", a good example is worth a thousand words.\nNot just any example, though - it should be:\n\ncomplete (also called self-contained or standalone).\nminimal\nreproducible\n\nLet's look at these traits in more detail.\nComplete\nA good example specifies everything that's necessary to replicate the issue on another person's computer. This includes version numbers of relevant components, imports, compiler flags, your OS type... and the exact steps to follow.\nIdeally, your example will be self-contained enough that to reproduce the issue, the person reading the report should be able to run a single command and see the same result as you did.\nFor example, a nix run call with a pinned Nix Flake reference is as complete as it gets. In the Scala ecosystem, recently it's been best practice to post a scala-cli Gist.\nIn case of open source projects, it can be very useful to write your reproduction in the style of a test case. Perhaps something that looks like this:\n\nWhen I do X, I see Y, but expect to see Z\n\nIf you want, you can actually submit a draft Pull Request with a failing test that does that.\nMinimal\nRemove all unnecessary clutter from any examples you post.\nThis includes any unused imports or variables, library dependencies, local files, other pieces of your project, and so on.\nOf course, if any of these is vital to reproducing the issue, you can leave them in, but make sure they can be used by anyone anytime. Anything else becomes a hindrance, so stick to the essentials.\nReproducible\nThis may already be covered by the \"complete\" part, but consider whether your example will behave the same way tomorrow, in a leap year, on a Windows machine, or on Mars.\nOkay, fine - it doesn't actually have to run on Windows 💀 but it's imperative that the problem doesn't only happen \"sometimes\", or that you make it blatantly obvious that it does.\nLast but not least, don't miss this crucial step:\nActually run the reproduction\nWhile you're minimizing an issue, it's quite easy to accidentally remove a seemingly innocent, yet vital piece of the setup that actually plays a role in the issue - making the code work as designed, instead of showcasing a problem.\nI'm sometimes guilty of skipping this step myself (embarrassingly often, really), but I've also seen a number of people make the same mistake - after all, these examples are so small, so simple... how can they be wrong?\nDo yourself a favor, add this step to your checklist: when posting a reproduction, make sure you actually run it before you submit it. If you're changing it after submission, run it again. Make sure the output matches what you reported.\nCommunication style\nLast but not least, we need to make sure someone actually reads our question and decides to help us. Proper communication is key!\nBe kind\nThis goes without saying: in a public forum, you're just a stranger on the Internet asking people to spend their time (a scarce resource) on your needs.\nIt doesn't mean you shouldn't ask your question, of course - that's what these places are for! Just be mindful of your tone and phrasing to make sure it doesn't come off as demanding or entitled.\nRespect the time and effort of people who offer to help you: even if it's part of their job, you owe it to them not to abuse their good intentions.\nBe clear\nRead your question in whole before you submit it.\nIf you have the time, do some basic editing. There is no single right way to do it, and from this point you can go as far as you like (running a spellchecker, Grammarly, and so on), just like in any other form of writing.\nSee if you can remove unnecessary, redundant words, break up longer sentences in your explanations or split your paragraphs into sections.\nHowever, don't sweat it - \"perfect\" is the enemy of \"done\", and the fact that you're trying is already going to get appreciated!\nDon't waste time\nRegardless of whether it's a public forum or a work Slack, it's best to avoid wasting time. On that front, one of the worst offenders are roundtrips.\nMinimize the amount of roundtrips by making your question complete (see the parts about Due dilligence, Context) - this will avoid unnecessary follow-up questions, and save time for both sides of the exchange.\nThe most extreme example of a useless roundtrip is sending a message that just says \"Hello\". Don't do it - the person reading that message will be forced to wait for the \"actual\" message you send, before they can even begin to try and help you. Even worse, they may see your message, start doing something else, then have to context switch again after you follow up with the question.\nAnother example: \"Does anybody here know X?\" - that's not the question you really want to ask, is it? Add the actual question in a thread or start with it in the first place.\nUse your judgement\n\nLearn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.\n-Pablo Picasso\n\nRemember, these are just hints and ideas - you don't always have to follow all of them. In certain environments, you'll find it best not to overwhelm people with information about your issue (e.g. if you're asking for general advice on a Slack channel),\nand sometimes you have to be more vague because of e.g. NDAs.\nIn synchronous, private conversations with a coworker you know well, you probably don't need to structure your messages as much as on a GitHub issue, and you can use less formal language as well.\nYou can also assume more about their knowledge of your problem and spare them the overview.\nKeep these tips in mind, but ultimately you'll have to follow your gut.\nSummary\nI hope these suggestions give you a baseline for the questions you'll ask in your career.\nThere's clearly more to it, and I'm not the first person to write about this problem either.\nYou'll find a lot of overlap with documents like \"How To Ask Questions The Smart Way\" - which is a good one, although I consider its tone a bit alienating to recommend it as a first point of contact.\nFeel free to share this post with your peers if you wish they gave you better questions, just...

In particular, I was wondering if it's possible to perform certain simple validations and encode their results in types. Here's what i found.\nWhat is coherent data\nThe concept of coherent data was introduced to me when I watched Daniel Spiewak's talk about coherence. Data coherence is achieved when we have a single source of truth about our data. Let's look at an example:\n\nIn this code we don't have any sort of coherence in the data. One condition that we check - the emptiness of name - gives us information that is immediately lost in the rest of the code. Even if we've checked for the emptiness and are sure that the Option isn't empty, there's nothing in the type system or any other feature of the language that would tell us whether we can call Option#get on it safely. We only know that because we keep in mind that we've already checked for the emptiness ourselves.\nAnother example involves lists:\n\nEven though we've checked for the list's emptiness, we still have no guarantee that head, which is in general not a safe method to call on a list, won't throw an exception.\nThere's no connection between isEmpty and head/get enforced by the compiler. It's just incapable of helping us avoid mistakes like this:\n\nIs this the way it's meant to be? Is it possible to make the compiler work with us to ensure some guarantees about our data?\nIn Kotlin, another language that works on the JVM (mostly), there is a feature that solves this particular problem we had with Option: smart casts. But the feature is limited to checking types or nullity, while we're looking for something that'll work in the general case.\nThankfully, there're features in Scala that allow us to reason about our data as coherent: pattern matching and higher-order functions.\nData coherence with pattern matching\nLet's rewrite the examples from the previous section using pattern matching:\n\nMuch better - now we managed to get both the emptiness check and the extraction in one go (in the pattern match). We're not calling any unsafe methods, and we get additional help from the compiler in the form of exhaustivity checking. What about lists?\n\nAgain, we're not calling head or any other unsafe method. And the check is again combined with the extraction in a single pattern match.\nI mentioned higher-order functions, so what about them? Turns out that pattern matches (and functions implemented using them) can often be rewritten using a single call to fold for the given data type. It's more obvious in the case of Option:\n\nOr Either:\n\nHowever, fold doesn't appear to be the right choice if we only care about part of the data (like in the list example, where we only needed the head of the list). In that particular case, a good old headOption would work just fine.\nData coherence at scale\nThis is all nice and pretty - the promise of having data that doesn't require us to watch our backs every step we take sounds encouraging. But when the data is part of other data, things start to break very soon.\nSuppose we're working with a User class:\n\nNow imagine we want to run a code path only if the user has a lastName set. The caveat: we still want to pass the User instance:\n\nWhat's the problem? Well, even though we did the validation in a coherent way using a pattern match, we lose the coherence inside withValidatedUser: lastName is now completely separated from the User object it came from. And now we have two lastNames: one optional, one required.\n\nThis is terrible news. It appears like we can't maintain data coherence when the data is part of something else. Or can we?\nSurely there are ways to get what we want - one of them is adding a new variant of the User class, but with a required lastName:\n\n...but you can probably already imagine how much boilerplate it'd bring to your codebase if you needed a new class for every combination of optional fields if the User type had more than one:\n\nIt doesn't seem like a viable solution to the problem. In fact, it'd create more problems than it solved.\nI entertained the idea that we could parameterize our original User with type parameters a bit:\n\nNow a few things happened:\n\nWe're not passing the lastName value separately now\nlastName being required is now a type-level prerequisite in withValidatedUser\nWe're copying the user value with lastName substituted with the value extracted from Option using a pattern match\nWe only have one data type that supports all combinations of emptiness/non-emptiness using type parameters.\n\nWhat does this give us?\nWe gained type safety in withValidatedUser - the function now can't be called with a User whose lastName hasn't been checked for non-emptiness. It just won't compile if we pass an Option in that field. One less test case to worry about.\nIt's also pretty interesting that we can now write functions that require the user to not have a second name:\n\nFor me, the most surprising part here was that I couldn't use Nothing as the type of lastName - which I wanted to do to guarantee that lastName just isn't there. However, we can't create values of type Nothing, and we can't pass them as constructor parameters of a class. I used Unit instead, which is a type with only one value, which is obviously not the user's last name. Creating a user with LastName = Unit is also very easy: User(\"Joe\",  ()).\nWhat's the problem with the latest solution?\n\nWe made it more difficult to work with the User type - now everyone who uses that type needs to be aware that the lastName field is parameterized. And it's viral - pretty soon all the codebase will be littered with type parameters irrelevant in these regions of code.\nWe can insert any type we want as LastName. It could even be IO[Unit]. And it's very easy to do so.\n\nLooks like we aren't quite there yet. What can we do to make our type easier to work with?\nA different kind of coherence\nOur original goal in the exercise was to encode validations and invariants of our data in the data's type. Let's get back to our User example. This time we'll encode it using higher-kinded types (but with two \"variable-effect\" fields):\n(if you're not familiar with higher-kinded types, I suggest you check out some blog posts. For now, it should be enough to know that a higher-kinded type is a type-level function, or a type that needs to be applied with another type to construct a fully concrete type that can be assigned to a value. For example Option needs an A to become Option[A], a type that has values.\nIf we parameterize User with higher-kinded types, we get this:\n\nCool. How do we create a User with all fields optional now?\n\nHow do we create one with some fields required?\n\nAlso cool. We can't assign None as the value of lastName if LastName is Id. How would we encode the requirement that there's no email now?\n\nAs you can see, we cheated a bit - the goal of parameterizing our type with higher-kinded types was to ensure that we always have String (or whatever used to be in an Option) in an effect (like Option or Id), but if the effect is A =&gt; Unit, we have no String in the result whatsoever. Is it bad?\nMaybe, maybe not.\nIf we have type parameters for our data, we can't make it obligatory to have String anywhere in the type of Email. (well, maybe we could, using some more type-level machinery and implicits, but I don't want to go that deep into it).\nHowever, we're making it harder to use a type that doesn't have the String in it (Option is a more obvious choice for a type parameter than, say, λ[A =&gt; Int], which would mean that lastName is of type Int). And we still get an escape hatch that allows us to omit some fields in a User value (by saying that lastName is of type Unit).\nInstead of a custom Void type, we could've used Const:\n\nWe had at least two problems with the previous solution:\n\nthe type parameters would spread out to every place in the codebase where User appears.\nwe didn't have type-level hints as to what type we should use.\n\nI believe the second problem is not an issue anymore (see above argument about Unit), but the first one remains: everywhere we had\ndef foo: User =&gt; A, we'll now have\ndef foo[F[_], G[_]]: User[F, G] =&gt; A. What can we do to make this a little more pleasant, and to avoid spreading every single type parameter to pieces of code that don't care about the contents of our parameterized fields?\nVariance and higher kinded types\nThankfully, Scala has quite powerful support for variance annotations. We can use it to our advantage: to make our type easier to work with.\nSuppose we are writing a function that takes a user but only uses their first name - which isn't type parameterized. Let's recall the definition of User:\n\nLet's add some variance annotations...\n\nMaking our type covariant in both type parameters should allow us to pass a User[F, G] for any F and G where a User[Any, Any] (User.Arb) is required. Let's see if it works:\n\nLooks like it does. However, maybe hardcoding Any, Any isn't the best solution there - what if at some point we actually want to perform some validation and use the parameterized fields? Maybe a better encoding would be this:\n\nNow we could write functions taking User.Canonical as the base case, and only customize the functions that we want to work with certain types of User specifically.\n\nOther possible use cases\nWhat other invariants can we encode?\n\nOption[A] can become A or Unit.\nEither[A, B] can become B or A.\nList[A] can become Unit (empty list) or (A, List[A]) (NonEmptyList[A]).\n\n(note how we're deconstructing the data types, which happen to be ADTs, into coproducts)\nIf we're really trying to experiment, we can go the extra mile:\n\nList[A] can be checked for length and encoded as Sized[List[A], 5].\nUser[IO[A]] can become IO[User[A]] (sounds like Traverse, doesn't it?) - we can run the IO outside and keep the result to avoid unnecessary recalculation.\nUser[Stream[IO, A]] can become IO[User[List[A]]] - we can run the stream and work with it as a list, once it's all consumed (that is, if it fits into the memory).\n\nThere's a lot we can do, really:\n\nString -&gt; NonEmptyString, regex\"(a-Z)+\", IPv4, INetAddress refined types\nInt -&gt; PosInt / EvenInt refined types, smaller primitives (Byte, etc.)\n\nSummary\nThere are a few good reasons for trying to make our data coherent, including but not limited to using the techniques mentioned in this post:\n\nadditional type safety by enforcing constraints locally on the type level\nincreased ease of putting code under test - if your function doesn't depend on lastName, you can pass () in that field safely\n\nHowever, there are difficulties associated with all that:\n\ntype parameters creeping into all your functions (possibly can be avoided by introducing a canonical type and only being specific when it's needed)\nit's questionable whether parameterizing data with types scales (e.g. if we have case class Users[Collection[_], LastName[_]](users: Collection[User[LastName]]), is it going to be easy to change?)\nthe benefit might not be that significant after all\nit was mentioned in the replies that type-parameterizing e.g. JSON models can break tooling like circe, magnolia, etc. - most likely because they don't support GADTs\npossibly more problems that I haven't figured out yet.\n\nI haven't seen this approach to abstracting on data used anywhere, so I don't know what the best practice is, and whether the idea is feasible for use in real projects, but it certainly seems worth investigating.\nMaybe type-parameterized data would work better with lenses (e.g. from Monocle) to make the work with copying more pleasant and less boilerplatey?\nAs some of our validations involved e.g. breaking up Option into a tagged coproduct of Unit and A (which it is), maybe the techniques mentioned in this post could be used together with optics like Prisms (which are meant for working with coproducts) to form more powerful abstractions?\nMaybe we could have a Monad/Traverse/whatever instance for a type like case class User[LastName[_], Email[_]](...) for each of its fields to get additional functionality for free using the functions defined on the appropriate typeclass?\nAs you can see, more insight into the possibilities is needed to determine if the concept can be used more widely in our code.\nParting words\nThank you for reading.\nThese ideas are very fresh for me, and I haven't spent a lot of time researching them yet. In the future, I hope to spend more time in this area and to develop a more formal or constrained description of the ideas mentioned here.\nMost importantly, I hope to find out whether these ideas actually help achieve more type safety without sacrificing maintainability in real world programming.\nLet me know what you think about the ideas presented in this post, and whether you enjoyed reading it!\nThanks to Igal Tabachnik (@hmemcpy) and Valérian (@etaty) who found and reported a few bugs in this post. I should get around to using mdoc already...\n","id":"https://blog.kubukoz.com/data-coherence-at-large/","title":"Data coherence at large"},"https://blog.kubukoz.com/flakes-first-steps/":{"body":"I keep getting questions about how to start with Nix. I believe the way to go in 2022 is to start with Flakes, so in this post I'll describe just that.\nIf you want to learn Nix from first principles instead, I recommend Nix Pills and nix.dev.\nTeaser: what's in it for me?\nImagine you wanted to try out a program someone recommended to you, but you didn't want to install it before getting an impression.\nOr maybe you want to ensure your team's project is always built with the same version of your build tools, regardless of what versions your team members might have installed on their machines.\nMaybe you already have a version of Node that's too new for a project, and you'd like to downgrade in the scope of that project (while keeping the latest version installed).\nNix's shells allow you to do all of these. A shell creates a temporary environment in which the selected programs are available.\nFor example, without writing any Nix files I can open a shell with the scala-cli package:\n\nNow get this: that command didn't actually install anything. When I leave the shell (with exit or ctrl+d), scala-cli is no longer usable, and it doesn't pollute my user environment.\nTo avoid repetition, share our shells with the team, and make them reproducible, we can define them in files. In that case, we would call nix develop inside the project's directory to open the shell it provides:\n\nShells are just one usecase of Nix, but I find that they're the one that brings the most value with minimal learning effort.\nRead on, and you will learn:\n\nhow to make isolated, reproducible and shareable shells with Nix Flakes\nwhere to find packages for those shells\nsome bits of Nix syntax and semantics\n\nand more. Let's get to it!\nWhat is Nix?\nTo get started with Flakes, it'd be nice if we knew what Nix was in the first place.\nNix is a purely functional package manager.\nIt has a unique combination of features that make it an interesting tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems - one of which is packaging a website (which is exactly how the page you're reading was generated and packaged).\nWhat are flakes?\nFlakes are a feature of Nix meant to enable distribution of Nix packages in a decentralized and reproducible manner.\nThey provide a standardized and consistent approach to dependency management, caching and the general user experience.\nThe main purpose of a Flake is to provide outputs: things like package definitions and shells.\nFlakes can also depend on each other to produce these outputs. Flake dependencies are generally called inputs.\nIf you want to get a more in-depth understanding of Flakes, there's documentation for the flake CLI, as well as a wiki entry and other blog posts trying to introduce you to flakes.\nFor now, let's try to use the feature, and hopefully, we'll get a better understanding of it along the way.\n\nEnabling flakes\n\nNote:\nFlakes are a (currently) experimental feature of Nix, and they've been present in the default distribution of Nix since release 2.4.\nThe \"experimental\" part sounds scary, but I've had a good and consistent experience for a year now, and it's probably a matter of (less rather than more) time until they are considered stable.\n\nFirst of all, you need Nix installed. For that, follow the official installation guide for your system.\nThe wiki lists several ways to enable flakes. I prefer this one:\nCreate the file ~/.config/nix/nix.conf (if it doesn't exist) and add this line to it:\n\nUsing flakes\nThe beauty of flakes is that you can build an arbitrary flake's output without dealing with the Nix language.\nNow that you have enabled Flakes, you can run this:\n\nIf that works, you've enabled flakes correctly. It's time to make our own flake.\nYour first flake\nThe simplest flake possible is one that produces no outputs:\n\nWe'll talk about the syntax later.\nSave this as flake.nix in a new directory and you'll be able to run:\n\nThe command should succeed with no output. Now let's make our flake a little more complicated...\n\n\nI know, that's a lot, but I promise we'll talk about it once we get it to work.\nSave the file and run nix flake check again. It might take a little while, but ultimately you should see the following happen:\n\n\nA flake.lock file is created\n\n\nThe command fails spectacularly:\n\n\n\nThere's a reason why it failed (don't worry about it yet). You can get it to succeed if you add --impure to the command, but it's a workaround - as you can guess, we'll try to get rid of that soon.\n\nLet's talk about what we've done so far. Specifically, let's talk about syntax!\nNix syntax 101\nIn the parts that the two languages share, Nix is actually quite similar to JSON (see manual for the Nix syntax).\nThe following JSON object:\n\ntranslates to the following Nix:\n\nYou should note the following key differences:\n\nentries in the object (Nix calls these attribute sets, or attrsets) are separated with semicolons\nthe trailing semicolon is required\nkeys/values are separated with the equals sign\nkeys aren't wrapped in quotes\narray elements are separated with whitespace\ncomments are allowed.\n\nNix syntax 102: functions\nIn addition to features known from formats like JSON, Nix has functions.\nFunctions in Nix are anonymous (they're lambdas), and they always take one argument each (multi-parameter functions are emulated either by means of currying or passing an attrset).\nThis is the general syntax for a function literal:\n\nLooks familiar? We saw a similar one in the first flake we've made:\n\nHere, we're seeing a new piece of syntax: the underscore. That just means we ignore the input and don't give it a name.\nFunctions are applied to arguments when they're separated by whitespace:\n\nTo sum up all of the above, here's our initial flake definition, annotated:\n\nA flake as a function\nJust to repeat and rephrase: a flake's outputs attribute is a function that takes the flake's inputs as an argument.\nIn the second flake, we saw this function literal as the definition of outputs:\n\nWhat is nixpkgs? What are the three dots? Let's start with the dots.\nTriple-dot syntax\nIn the above snippet, we have a function literal that looks like this:\n\nWhen you see an attrset in the input position of a function, it means you're looking at a pattern match (or destructuring). nixpkgs will be considered a required attribute, but because of the three dots any extra arguments will be ignored - normally, if you only list specific attributes like in\n\nthen calling the function with any extra attributes provided at the call site will cause an error:\n\nNixpkgs\nNixpkgs is the main repository containing definitions of packages for Nix. At the time of writing, it's the largest package repository tracked by Repology.\nThe nixpkgs parameter is the result of fetching the nixpkgs input. Remember, we defined our inputs as:\n\nwhich is syntactic sugar for the following:\n\nand it's Nix's equivalent of saying:\n\nThe nixos/nixpkgs GitHub repository will be tracked by Nix and within our flake aliased under the name nixpkgs (the name we defined for the input). By convention you'll usually see these names match the repository that the flake is coming from.\nThe first time an input is used in a flake command, Nix will pin it.\nPinning an input means that Nix will figure out the exact revision that it fetched, and it will make sure that everybody using this flake gets the exact same one.\nAt the time I'm writing this, pinning github:nixos/nixpkgs creates the following flake.lock file:\n\nWe don't need to talk about all of it (the file's main purpose is to be machine-readable), but please notice this part:\n\nThat's the commit hash of Nixpkgs's master branch that was found when I referenced the flake.\nThe lockfile makes sure that the flake's inputs are reproducible. In fact, if you copy-pasted flake.nix and flake.lock to another machine, Nix would guarantee that the same version of Nixpkgs would be used - kind of like saying \"after you clone this Git repository, always check out this revision\".\nUntil you explicitly ask Nix to update an input (with something like nix flake update), it will remain unchanged. When you change it, the lockfile will be updated as well.\nFlake outputs\nLet's look at the output we defined for our flake earlier.\n\nHere, you can see let bindings in play: it's another feature of the Nix language.\nA let binding declares a named value that can be used in the statements that follow.\nIn the snippet above, we define system and pkgs in a single binding so they can refer to each other.\nLet's assume we're running an ARM-based Mac machine. The builtins.currentSystem string would have a value of \"aarch64-darwin\", and our flake would return a single output: devShells.aarch64-darwin.default.\nSome other popular system values you might want to use:\n\naarch64-linux, for ARM-based Linux\nx86_64-linux, for Intel-based Linux\nx86_64-darwin, for Intel-based macOS\n\nWe can use that output by entering the development shell it defines:\n\nWe're relying on a couple defaults here, but the nix develop command opened a Bash shell with the cowsay package already available on our $PATH. How did it happen?\nFirst, we're relying on a couple defaults: nix develop on its own is equivalent to nix develop ., meaning \"the default shell for the flake in the working directory\".\nOn top of that, nix develop . means Nix will try to use the first output it finds when trying the following:\n\ndevShells.&lt;currentSystem&gt;.default, or\npackages.&lt;currentSystem&gt;.default.\n\nFor this article, we don't care about the latter.\nReading the \"current system\" is considered an impurity in Nix, and as such it's allowed in the command line, but not in pure evaluation mode (the default for Flakes): the expansion of the command happens in the CLI, whereas the evaluation of a flake happens in the Nix build system.\n\nAn \"impurity\" here means it's not \"purely functional\".\nThe purely functional paradigm only allows an expression to depend on the values of other expressions, and something like \"the current system\", \"the current time\" or \"the current text of the file at path /xyz\" would require reaching beyond the scope of our code and getting the value from the local system.\nNix relies on purity to deliver some of its guarantees, so it encourages pure definitions for the code you write for it.\nIn Flakes, --impure is an escape hatch that allows breaking some of these rules of purity.\n\nShells and packages\nBack to our output - it's defined as the following:\n\nmkShell is a function in Nixpkgs that takes an attrset as an argument. One of the attributes in it is packages, which can be used to list... packages (who knew, right?) that will be available in the shell environment once it's loaded.\npkgs.cowsay is a reference to one of the packages in Nixpkgs - you can search for these packages in a variety of ways, one which is search.nixos.org.\nWe could get more packages into our shell by listing them in the attribute:\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, these two packages showcase one of Nix's greatest features - isolation.\nscala-cli has a runtime dependency on a Java runtime, and it requires it to be version 17 or above. \"But we're also adding openjdk11, surely that'll conflict, right?\"\nWell, no - scala-cli's dependency is isolated: no other packages will see it.\n\nBut wait! We didn't talk about pkgs, did we? Also, we still have this impurity of builtins.currentSystem that we should deal with, so that we don't need that --impure parameter in every call to the Nix CLI.\nsystems and pkgs\npkgs was defined by using the import function (part of Nix's standard library):\n\nA couple things to explain here: import x means:\n\nread the file at path x\nparse it as a Nix expression\nreturn that expression\n\nAdditionally, we have a function call just after the import: you could've written the same thing as\n\nFinally, inherit system is syntactic sugar for system = system. We forward the value of system currently in scope or, in other words, we make the attrset \"inherit\" the system value from its definition's scope.\nReminder: nixpkgs is the input Nix fetched for our flake based on how we defined nixpkgs in the inputs section on the top-level of the flake.\nFlake inputs are fetched to paths on the file system, and the value of the input (the nixpkgs value we got as a parameter of outputs) is that path. Given what we now know, we can tell that pkgs will be the result of calling some function defined in the Nix expression for Nixpkgs.\nHere's the thing: packages in Nix can have different needs and different ways of being built, depending on what system they're being built for.\nMost packages have dependencies on other, low-level packages (like the C compiler or another build tool), which are inherently platform-specific.\nThis is why you need to specify the system that Nixpkgs should use as a default when giving you access to packages.\nSo... we need a system. But builtins.currentSystem is impure, so how do we deal with that?\nRemember: Nix's CLI already does the currentSystem check. We only really used it in the flake for convenience.\nAssuming you only need your flake to work on one platform, you might as well hardcode the system like this:\n\nand it would work! Also, it would have no impurities. The day is saved... but is that it?\nSupporting multiple systems\nWith the change from above, our flake looks like this:\n\nWe can list all of its outputs using the nix flake show command:\n\nWe've eliminated the impurity from our flake, but at the cost of only supporting one system.\nHow can we add support for others?\nLet's recap a couple facts:\n\nFlake outputs are system specific\nbuiltins.currentSystem is not allowed in pure evaluation mode\nThe Nix CLI (e.g. nix develop) knows what system it's running on\nwe need a system to make a pkgs\n\nIn theory, there's nothing stopping us from copy-pasting a bunch of code to support more systems:\n\nbut in practice, it gets real tedious real quick. It's boilerplate of the kind that we wouldn't like to maintain!\nThankfully, Nix's language and standard library offer ways to generate attrsets given a list of keys.\nI won't get into the gnarly details (this is the kind of thing you learn in Nix Pills), but the solution I like most is a higher-order function that'll take the following arguments:\n\na list of system names\na closure (function) that receives a system name and produces outputs for that system.\n\nThe usage of that function, let's call it eachSystem, would look like this:\n\nBy pure accident and not a completely deliberate choice of naming/syntax, this already exists!\nIt's indeed named eachSystem and it's provided by the flake-utils flake.\nWith flake-utils, our final flake could look like this:\n\nflake-utils provides a lib output that doesn't require a system - it only uses Nix's standard library to transform the list of systems and the function we pass to it.\nThe eachSystem function will take the list of systems we want to support, and make sure the default entry in devShells ends up under the key specific to each system:\n\nYou might also want to try eachDefaultSystem, which hardcodes the list of systems to the \"default\" platforms listed in flake-utils. Also, check out simpleFlake.\nOn ease of use\nNow, I know all of this is pretty complicated. There's still a high barrier to entry and a steep learning curve to getting started with Nix, even with Flakes being an attempt to simplify the ways of working with it.\nThere are ongoing discussions around the usability of Nix and of Flakes, and we're likely to see improvements to it in the future, but so far it's as simple as it gets.\nWhile I wish it could be simplified for the beginner user, I understand that Nix deals with a lot of essential complexity (inherent to the problem it attempts to solve). It's not optimizing for the \"hello world\" experience - it optimizes for the build system working at scale, when the builds and shells get more convoluted.\nI trust that its creators know how complex the average build can get, given they've been working with this ecosystem for almost 20 years.\nThere are other tools built on top of Nix that provide a more newcomer-friendly experience. One of them is devshell (which I think could use some simplification in the documentation). If you want to get the Nix shell powers without forcing your entire team to learn the language, that might work for you.\nParting words\nTo sum up, in this article we covered:\n\na brief introduction to Nix and Flakes\ndefining a Nix shell in a flake\nsome parts of the Nix language's syntax\nsupporting multiple systems\n\nas well as a couple other things.\nI hope that it gives you a decent enough introduction to Flakes that will help you start enjoying the benefits of Nix, as well as encourage you to learn the parts we didn't cover, on your own.\nIf you have any questions that you feel this post should've answered but didn't, let me know in the comments below.\nThanks for reading!\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to Olivier Mélois for an initial read of this post.\n","id":"https://blog.kubukoz.com/flakes-first-steps/","title":"Nix Flakes: first steps"},"https://blog.kubukoz.com/flavors-of-shared-state/":{"body":"In this post, we will explore the various ways to share state in a Cats Effect application.\nIntroduction: why do we need shared state?\nOne may think that Functional Programming eliminates the need for shared state altogether - however, sooner or later, we have to interact with the so called \"Real World\". Turns out, the world is a JoJo reference a stateful thing, so interacting with it requires some form of effects.\nAs if that wasn't enough, sometimes we want to keep some state in our own application: even something like a \"request counter\", which keeps a running total of the requests handled by the service, requires some form of shared in-memory state.\nThen we have more complex concepts such as connections, resource pools, queues, rate limiters and so on, all of which are by nature stateful as well.\nLet's take Cats Effect for a spin and see what tools we can use to build such mechanisms.\nWorking example: simple counter\nFollowing the idea of a request counter, let's use this concept for our example.\nOur counter will have two operations:\n\nStarting simple: Ref\nFirst, we'll define a helper to reduce the boilerplate in our implementations:\n\nNow let's try and implement the counter with our good old friend, cats.effect.kernel.Ref.\n\nWe can now instantiate such a counter and use it, including in concurrent scenarios:\n\nLet's see what that gives us:\n\nClearly, some sharing happened: the value was updated twice!\nWhat are the characteristics of this counter?\n\nIt can be atomically updated from multiple fibers\nThe count is shared everywhere within the scope where the counter is visible, i.e. within the for comprehension.\n\nThat makes it suitable for a counter of all requests an application has received while it's up. However, let's imagine we need some more isolation: let's try to count all client requests that we've made while handling a server request.\nWe'll make the simplest client call possible:\n\nand our request handler may look like this (with http4s):\n\nCan we use refCounter for this purpose? Sure, why not. We'll increment before the request, to avoid dealing with error handling. We'll also return the final value in the response:\n\nLet's try it out:\n\n\nIt... does work. Notably, we can't put the refCounter.flatMap part outside of our router, as that'd make the counter shared across all requests: remember, we wanted to isolate the counts of each request we handle.\nLet's hide the increments in a client middleware, to declutter the code a bit:\n\nNow here's the updated routing code:\n\nIt still feels cluttered, doesn't it? Also, that's probably the most obvious problem with our example - but there's an even more serious one that's likely to bite us when we try to build something real. Let's discuss that.\nIn our example, the client calls are happening directly in the route (the request handler). However, in a real application it's very likely to be wrapped in at least one layer of abstraction: this could be a UserService, which would in turn use a UserClient, which would be the one actually using Client.\nIt might look a little like this:\n\nIn such a design, the http4s Client is nowhere to be seen - it's encapsulated in the definition of UserService (and possibly even further). How do we tell it about the counter, then? Do we add a Counter parameter to all the methods of UserService and its dependencies, all the way until we have access to the http4s Client?\nWell, that'd work, but it'd certainly go against the point of all this abstraction. Surely we can find something else.\nAll we need is to propagate the Counter from our request handler to the client. If this sounds to you like a Reader monad, that's certainly one tool to achieve this! However, we're not always going to be able to use it:\n\nit implies that UserService's methods have a reader monad in their return types\n\nthis means that we either use polymorphic effects (AKA Tagless Final), or hardcode the exact reader monad with the exact type of context that we we need (Counter)\n\n\nthis approach is still \"viral\", i.e. it infects the interfaces of not only UserService, but also its peers (the UserClient mentioned earlier)\n\nSo let's not do that here. If we're not going to pass the counter as parameters (or a reader monad), could we inject the counter to the UserService at construction time, then?\n\nLooks like we can. However, this is a bit of a code smell: the fact that UserService depends (indirectly) on the counter is now visible to our routing. In addition, whenever we receive a request, we have to construct not only a UserService, but also every component that carries the Counter dependency. We'd have to measure the performance impact of such allocations on the hot path, and it'd certainly have severe implications if any of these components are stateful themselves.\nWe won't be doing that, then. So what are our demands?\n\nThe counter dependency should be hidden from intermediate layers of abstraction (only the client and router need to know about it)\nThe counter's state should be isolated between requests, including concurrent ones.\n\nReaders with Java experience may recognize this as something similar to ThreadLocal. However, in Cats Effect we can't simply use a ThreadLocal, because due to its fiber-based concurrency model, a single request may be processed on any number of threads (and on non-JVM platforms like Scala.js, we might only have one thread to begin with).\nWhat we need is more of a... \"fiber\" local.\nIsolated state with IOLocal\nCats Effect provides an IOLocal. It does exactly what we want! Let's implement the counter with it:\n\nNow, we can create one IOLocal-backed Counter for our entire application, and share it.\nAs a good practice we'll reset each counter after each server request finishes processing (just in case any fibers are recycled between serial requests), but in reality it's likely that we'll just get a new fiber for each request.\nFor this, we'll need to enhance our definition of localCounter with the ability to reset it after we're done. I'm choosing to do this by composition, although inheritance could also be a reasonable choice:\n\nWe'll also need to enhance our router so that it actually resets the local. Let's make another middleware:\n\nIf you want to be more concise:\n\nNow we're armed and we can get to the action:\n\nAnd we've achieved our desired goal! To sum up, here's what's happening:\n\nWe create an IOLocal-based counter and open a scope of sharing by mapping on it. The resultant IO can be flatMapped on directly in your IOApp, as soon as you have a Client. If you only flatMap once, you'll have a globally-shared IOLocal (which is likely what you want).\nWe wrap the \"real\" http4s Client with middleware that increments the count before sending any request.\nWe pass the wrapped client to the routes. In the UserService example above, at this point we could deal with the construction of any UserService dependencies, and it'd only happen once, instead of on every request.\nWe wrap the routes in middleware that resets the counter after processing each request.\n\nLet's test that as well:\n\nSo... is that it? Well, sort of.\nChild fibers\nIn our desire to share the Counter instance across the entire app, we've forgotten something important: we actually want some isolation. And yes, we do have isolation between the requests processed by the application, but what if the request itself is split into multiple fibers?\nWhat if the route actually looks like this?\n\nIt's a critical difference: the two requests will now be executed in parallel. Because IOLocal doesn't propagate changes from a child fiber to its parent, the global counter will now be unaffected by anything that's been forked! This could be a problem. And it is!\n\nSome boilerplate to prepare for that test run\n\n\n\nHere's the thing: Ref didn't care about the fibers' family drama. If only we could pick and choose which parts of IOLocal and Ref we get...\nWell, why don't we? Why don't we put a Ref inside IOLocal? Let's ponder:\nIOLocal[A] ensures that updates of A are not propagated to parent/child fibers. This can be done without inspecting the internals of the A value, by relying on its immutability to avoid sharing changes.\nIf A contains mutable state (which Ref pretty much is), you could mutate that state without ever calling update on the IOLocal... and it'll be visible in all offspring of the fiber that inserted that value.\nHere's what this trick would look like: we can use CounterWithReset to encapsulate the \"swapping\" of the Ref for each request:\n\nThis may be a lot to take, so let's go through the steps one by one:\n\nWe create a Ref as an initial value for the IOLocal. You could avoid this by making the IOLocal store an Option[Ref], but I figured this would make it easier to implement the other parts. That Ref is immediately used to create the IOLocal.\nWe make a Counter instance based on the composed IOLocal and Ref. Neither of the methods of the counter actually update the Local: they both read from it and then behave just like a normal Ref-based counter would.\nBefore each request, we'll create a fresh Ref and put it into the Local. Afterwards, we'll reset the Local to its previous state, for good measure.\nFinally, we return the counter with its reset button.\n\nThe usage of localRefCounter is identical to that of localCounterR.\n\nSome boilerplate to prepare for that test run\n\n\nDoes it resolve the issue?\n\nApparently, it does!\nWhat about the opposite?\nPerhaps you were wondering if we can flip the order of \"state carriers\" around and have Ref[IO, IOLocal[A]]. I would be inclined to say no, because the standard Ref implementation relies on a CAS (compare and set) loop for its updates, and that might not play well with how IOLocal is implemented. However, you're welcome to try... in a controlled environment :)\nCan we go deeper?\nWe've established that with the composition of IOLocal and Ref we have more control over when we \"fork\" the scope of our state than if we were using either of them separately.\nJust how much control are we talking, exactly?\nTurns out, we can freely \"fork\" whenever we want - just like we do in withFreshK - it's just a matter of exposing such a feature through our counter's API.\n\nIt's worth noting that at this point we cannot really implement a valid Counter based on just a Ref - by giving out API more power, we've constrained the number of valid implementations - constraints liberate, liberties constrain.\nOf course, if you want to control the value that forked counters will start with, you'll need to further adjust the API to accomodate that feature. This is left as an exercise for the reader.\nTrivia: Natchez's Trace algebra\nThe Natchez library, which is used for distributed tracing, uses a similar idea in its Trace algebra:\n\nIts two main implementations (based on Kleisli or IOLocal) both carry a Span, which is backed by mutable state - depending on the backend it's sometimes a Ref, sometimes a plain mutable object like an OpenTracing Span.\nSummary\nWe've explored a bunch of options for sharing state, with various degrees of isolation. Which one should you use?\nIt depends on the problem you're trying to solve. If your goal is to share the state for the entire application (for example, for a client's rate limiter), Ref will do just fine. If you want to prioritize isolation and avoid any race conditions, IOLocal may work well for you. However, if you want more precise control and the ability to \"disconnect\" from a more \"global\" state, it's likely that you'll want to wrap some mutable state in an IOLocal - such as a Ref.\nPersonally, I believe for most usecases in HTTP applications that desire \"reader monad\" semantics of state, IOLocal + Ref should be preferred over just IOLocal. Using the latter is likely to lead to subtle bugs, such as changes not being propagated upwards when a library down the call stack starts to involve concurrency.\nKeep in mind: Cats Effect has other building blocks for concurrent applications, and some of them might be better suited for solving certain types of problems. I encourage you to check out the documentation to learn more about them.\nI hope this article helps you make an informed decision.

In fact, often it seems to be one of the hardest things\nin computer science and programming in general. In addition, sometimes a single word has multiple meanings,\nor worse - a term is explained in a variety of slightly differing definitions. One such term is a pure function.\n\nI'm by no means an expert in functional programming, but the definition of a pure function that I consider to be true\nis the same one as plenty of people use.\nThat definition doesn't distinguish pure and impure functions, though - all functions are\npure, but the impure things we sometimes call functions, aren't. They are impure, and I call them procedures.\nWhat makes a function a function, then?\nThe point of this post is to answer that question in a way that'll be relatively easy\nto understand for people with basic to intermediate experience with programming and Scala.\nThe definition for a function (and for functional programming) I use is very similar\nto the one John A de Goes tweeted some time ago. Functions are:\n\nTotal - they are defined for every input\nDeterministic - a function will always return the same value given the same input.\nPure - their only effect is computing their output\n\nIf we define functions like the above, then functional programming is\nprogramming with functions,without procedures.\nLet's look at these properties and see how they differ from those of what I defined as procedures.\nTotality\nFor a function to be total, we must make sure that it returns a value\nfor every kind of input that the compiler allows it to take.\nThat means it can't throw exceptions to the caller, like in the following example:\n\nThe above code compiles, and validate(\"\") will compile too (as a method call\nwith a result type of String), but it'll crash at runtime, unless the exception is caught.\nThat makes validate a partial function, because it doesn't have a\ndefined value of its declared type (String) for an empty string - in fact,\nit doesn't have one for any kind of input consisting exclusively of whitespace.\nOne functional alternative to this would be to use Option:\n\nOr, if you want more information about the origin of failure, Either (if you\nlike typed errors, that'd probably involve creating an ADT for possible errors):\n\nAnother solution would involve tagless style with ApplicativeError:\n\nBy moving from throwing exceptions, we gain in at least a few ways:\n\nit becomes more explicit for the callers what kind of errors they can observe in case of failure\nthe types will tell us whether a function actually can fail or not\nwe avoid the overhead of creating an exception\n\nand our function becomes total, because invalid inputs will give us a value (e.g. a Left)\nDeterminism\nIn order for a function to be deterministic, it has to return the same value\nevery time it's called with the same arguments. Because of that, something like the following is not pure:\n\nThe type of foo is () =&gt; Int, or Unit =&gt; Int, so we can basically say that\nit has one possible input (the value () of type Unit, in this case represented\nby \"no arguments passed\"). This would mean that every call to this function will\nreturn the same value, but it's quite the opposite - it'll usually return completely different values.\nA simple way to ensure determinism of the above would be to allow passing\na seed to the randomizer, instead of using a global Random instance:\n\nNow, calling foo with the same input will yield the same outputs.\nAnother example of a nondeterministic function can be a simple call to a database:\n\nThe Await call was added only to make sure that we have a result immediately when the function completes.\nIf we change the state of the database between a few calls to this function,\nit'll yield different results. A functional, yet implausible solution would be to\npass the state of the database as input to the function, or use some sort of State monad.\nAn alternative, arguably better solution would be to suspend\nthe side effect (reading from external mutable state) in an effect,\nwhich is what we'll discuss in the part of this post about First-class effects.\nPurity\nI already said that a function is pure because its only effect is computing its output.\nDoes it mean that by programming with functions we aren't allowed to write to a database or to standard output?\nNot at all! Writing functions that execute I/O operations, or any other kind of effects,\nis possible, and it's way easier than naming things, in fact. However, it doesn't mean\nwe're allowed to have functions with side effects.\nWhat does it mean to have side effects, and how do we get effects (like talking to\nexternal systems) without side effects? We need referential transparency.\nAnd side effects are its exact opposite.\nReferential transparency\nA definition of referential transparency found in\nThe red book (Functional Programming in Scala by Runar Bjarnason and Paul Chiusano)\nsays:\n\nAn expression e is referentially transparent if, for all programs p,\nall occurrences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e\nwithout affecting the meaning of p.\nA function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent\nfor all referentially transparent x.\n\nLet me follow up with an example:\n\nOur e is a + 1. Our program p has two appearances of e.\nIn its current shape, the value of p can be computed by calculating a, e and p in that order:\n\nIf we can apply the replacement of e in the original program with\nthe result of evaluating e (a + 1), then e is referentially transparent. Let's do that:\n\nWhat's the value of p now?\np = ((2 + 1) + 1) + (2 + 1) + 1) = (3 + 1) + (3 + 1) = 4 + 4 = 8\nAs you see, the value of p hasn't changed. The behavior of\nthe program p didn't change either, as its only effect was computing the value (which is 8). That means e was referentially transparent - we replaced the reference to a value (e) with the value (a + 1).\nThis is very much like math from school - you didn't see\nanything impure in your textbooks, all your expressions were pure,\nand you could apply substitution in a similar way:\n\nSo far, no side effects. Let's introduce some:\n\nIf we ran the above lines in a REPL session, or as part of a larger program, the effects would be:\n\nthe value of p becomes 2 (every time)\nthe line Foo is printed to console output once.\n\nWhat would happen if we inlined x into the places where it's used?\n\nNow, if we ran the above lines, the result would be vastly different from the previous one, perhaps unsurprisingly:\n\nthe value of p still becomes 2 (every time)\nthe line Foo is printed to console output twice.\n\nUnless all the effects of your programs are idempotent\n(running them multiple times yields the same result as running them once),\nwhich I doubt, then this should feel troubling: after all,\nthe only thing we did was inline a read-only variable (val x).\nAnd now the program behaves in a different way.\nThat's precisely because the implementation of x was impure - it had\na secondary effect (or a side effect) of console output. This could just as well be\na database-mutating call, or a HTTP POST request being sent to a remote server.\nIn many cases, it would become a bug.\nThere are other ways to break referential transparency.\nIf the value of x depended on external conditions (like if it was getting its value from console input),\nthe correctness of the program after inlining could break in many more ways:\n\nIn the above code, the tuple contained by prog1 will always have\nthe same value in both fields. In fact, if we only ran the code up to the definition of prog1:\n\nWe would be asked to enter console input once, and the value we typed\nwould be stored in x for as long as x's lifetime lasts. Because of that, it'd appear twice in prog1.\nHowever, if we only ran the line where prog2 is defined:\n\nWe would be asked for input twice, and assuming there are n possible strings\nwe could input, the chance that both values in prog2 would be the same\nwould be equal to only 1/n (as opposed to 100% in prog1). And the only difference\nbetween prog1 and prog2 was the inlining of x = StdIn.readLine().\nThere are many other ways to break referential transparency in Scala, for example throwing exceptions:\n\nor executing any kind of impure logic inside scala.concurrent.Future:\n\nFuture behaves just like a raw, uncut side effect: its value is cached, so regardless of how many times you use\nan already created Future, it'll only run once and it'll always contain the same value upon completion or failure.\nThat's because Future isn't a description of an asynchronous computation: it's already running one.\nIf we can't rely on Future to give us the safety of refactoring (inlining values or extracting expressions to values),\ndoes it mean we're doomed to have side effects in meaningful Scala programs?\nThankfully, it doesn't.\nFirst-class effects\nA term often used to describe effects without side effects is \"first class effects\". They are effects that don't break\nreferential transparency. A workaround often used to simulate support for first class effects in Scala\ninvolves by-name parameters:\n\nIn this example, we created a new, \"artificial\" type Effectful[T] (it's probably not a good idea to try\nand come up with a type like this on your own). It describes a computation that will complete with a value of type T.\nWe gave it a method zip that will produce a new Effectful that will run two Effectful programs sequentially.\nIf we were to call prog1.run() or prog2.run(), you'd see that they behave identically - they'll both print Foo twice.\nThankfully, we don't need to come up with a type like this (and I don't recommend that you do - unless\nyou're absolutely sure the existing ones don't meet your needs).\nThere's plenty of competing options one can use in a similar way to how we used Effectful and def effect.\nHere are a few that are the most popular in late 2018:\n\ncats-effect IO[+A]\nscalaz-zio IO[+E, +A]\nMonix Task[+A].\n\nFrom the referential transparency/purity point of view, they behave in the same way - if we \"suspend\" side-effecting\noperations using an operator that allows \"delaying\" a computation (for example, by taking a by-name parameter),\nthey'll give us the properties we need. One significant difference in the above is in terms of\nerror handling - zio allows an IO to fail with an error value of type E that you can specify on your own,\nbut the other two (cats-effect IO and Monix Task) only allow failure with values that extend Throwable.\nWhether one solution has significant advantages over the other is a question for a different post ;)\nAll things considered, all of the above types support suspending synchronous effects (like printing to standard output,\nor executing a JDBC call) and asynchronous, non-blocking effects (like communicating through HTTP or\nlistening for messages from Kafka). The main difference between these types and Future is that they are able to\ndescribe a computation that can be ran at some point after they're defined, while Future is\na handle to an already running computation.\nFor the next part of the post, I'll use cats-effect's IO.\nLet's recreate the printing example that we were able to make referentially transparent with Effectful:\n\nAgain, running prog1 and/or prog2 will involve printing twice in each of them. That's why\nwe say IO is referentially transparent, or pure.\nA word on determinism and IO\nEarlier, I claimed that a function needs to return the same output for the same input. Would this be a function, then?\n\nSome people would argue that it's not - because it's not deterministic. They argue that calling foo multiple times\nwill give you different results. But that's not true - just calling foo always gives you\nthe same action - nothing happens until you evaluate the IO. In fact, the whole function could be a constant:\n\nAnd as a constant it must be deterministic. The fact that evaluating it multiple times will give us different\nresults doesn't matter. One of the points of functions being deterministic is to allow storing them as values,\nand reusing them. Take a look:\n\nBecause all the calls to foo are the same, we can store the result of such a call and reuse it, while maintaining\nthe original behavior:\n\n\"How do we evaluate an IO?\", you may ask. I'll respond, \"with IOApp\" (for example):\n\nThanks for reading\nI hope that you liked this not-so-short explanation of pure functions and that you'll benefit from it as much as me\nand other people who believe in functional programming.
